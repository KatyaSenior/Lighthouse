          <h3>Ancient Lighthouses</h3>
          <p>
            Before the development of clearly defined ports, mariners were
            guided by fires built on hilltops. Since elevating the fire would
            improve visibility, placing the fire on a platform became a practice
            that led to the development of the lighthouse.[1] In antiquity, the
            lighthouse functioned more as an entrance marker to ports than as a
            warning signal for reefs and promontories, unlike many modern
            lighthouses. The most famous lighthouse structure from antiquity was
            the Pharos of Alexandria, Egypt, which collapsed following a series
            of earthquakes between 956 CE and 1323 CE.

            The intact Tower of Hercules at A Coru√±a, Spain gives insight into
            ancient lighthouse construction; other evidence about lighthouses
            exists in depictions on coins and mosaics, of which many represent
            the lighthouse at Ostia. Coins from Alexandria, Ostia, and Laodicea
            in Syria also exist.

          <h3>Modern Construction</h3>
          <p>
            The modern era of lighthouses began at the turn of the 18th century,
            as the number of lighthouses being constructed increased
            significantly due to much higher levels of transatlantic commerce.
            Advances in structural engineering and new and efficient lighting
            equipment allowed for the creation of larger and more powerful
            lighthouses, including ones exposed to the sea. The function of
            lighthouses was gradually changed from indicating ports to the
            providing of a visible warning against shipping hazards, such as
            rocks or reefs.

            The Eddystone Rocks were a major shipwreck hazard for mariners
            sailing through the English Channel.[2] The first lighthouse built
            there was an octagonal wooden structure, anchored by 12 iron
            stanchions secured in the rock, and was built by Henry Winstanley
            from 1696 to 1698. His lighthouse was the first tower in the world
            to have been fully exposed to the open sea.[3]
