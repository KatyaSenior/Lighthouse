        <h3>Ancient Lighthouses</h3>
        <p>
          Before the development of clearly defined ports, mariners were guided
          by fires built on hilltops. Since elevating the fire would improve
          visibility, placing the fire on a platform became a practice that led
          to the development of the lighthouse.[1] In antiquity, the lighthouse
          functioned more as an entrance marker to ports than as a warning
          signal for reefs and promontories, unlike many modern lighthouses. The
          most famous lighthouse structure from antiquity was the Pharos of
          Alexandria, Egypt, which collapsed following a series of earthquakes
          between 956 CE and 1323 CE.

          The intact Tower of Hercules at A Coru√±a, Spain gives insight into
          ancient lighthouse construction; other evidence about lighthouses
          exists in depictions on coins and mosaics, of which many represent the
          lighthouse at Ostia. Coins from Alexandria, Ostia, and Laodicea in
          Syria also exist.
